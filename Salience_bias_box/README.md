# Salience bias box

The user is presented with a box with seemingly random number of buttons and elements.
One element is a button that is heart shaped, one is labeled with a skull and bones
icon, and others are of different shapes and colors. Some elements will produce
side-effects like sound, other will do nothing.

The task for the user would be to test the salience effect premise - will the user
assign more values to buttons that look “more important” like the kill button,
buttons that are larger, buttons that produce side-effects like sound, or those
who do absolutely nothing. Another possible route for user experiments is to test users
conviction that the button importance is valid even if no side-effects are produced.
